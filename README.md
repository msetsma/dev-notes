# My Dev Notes

## Welcome

My goals is to offload my cogntive load, increasing . This repository is a collection of code snippets, articles, and notes on various topics in software engineering.

It is a living document that I will continue to update. 

## Philosophy

I believe in the power of knowledge and the impact it can have on personal growth and fostering community learning. This repository is my contribution to that belief.

## Contributing

If you have any insights, code snippets, or resources you believe would enrich this repository, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I'm always open to learning from others and sharing knowledge.
